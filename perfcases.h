 *	Setup:
 *		Tspi_Context_Create
 *		Tspi_Context_Connect
 *		Tspi_Context_CreateObject(NV object)
 *		Setsecret to TPM policy with the correct owner passwd
 *		Tspi_SetAttribUint32(Index, permission, datasize)
 *		(The Index is 0x00011101)
 *		(The Permission is OWNERWRITE)
 *		(The datasize is 40)
 *		Tspi_NV_ReleaseSpace
 *
 * Run:	
 *		Evaluation fails on Attibute setting failures and 
 *      NVRAM write failure.
